# ♻️ Waste-Management-Optimization-with-Geospatial-Analytics

**Using Python, SQL, GIS, Machine Learning & Power BI**

This project analyzes waste collection patterns, route efficiency, bin-level fill volumes, and geospatial distribution of service demands to optimize municipal or commercial waste management systems. By integrating IoT sensor data, geospatial mapping, and ML-based demand forecasting, the solution identifies cost-saving opportunities, reduces fuel consumption, and improves operational efficiency.
