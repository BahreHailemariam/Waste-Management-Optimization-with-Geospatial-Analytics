# ♻️ Waste-Management-Optimization-with-Geospatial-Analytics

**Using Python, SQL, GIS, Machine Learning & Power BI**

This project analyzes waste collection patterns, route efficiency, bin-level fill volumes, and geospatial distribution of service demands to optimize municipal or commercial waste management systems. By integrating IoT sensor data, geospatial mapping, and ML-based demand forecasting, the solution identifies cost-saving opportunities, reduces fuel consumption, and improves operational efficiency.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Analyze waste collection volumes, route distance, and service frequency

- Identify inefficiencies in current waste collection schedules

- Use **geospatial clustering (K-Means / DBSCAN)** to optimize bin groups

- Create **route optimization models** (shortest path, TSP, VRP)

- Predict waste fill levels using machine learning

- Visualize operational KPIs in **Power BI**

- Produce actionable insights for reducing cost, improving sustainability, and streamlining collection operations
